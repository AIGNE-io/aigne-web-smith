# Custom Rules: Define specific documentation generation rules and requirements
rules: |
  ### Content Quality & Tone
  1. Avoid exaggerated marketing wording: Replace subjective adjectives (e.g., "powerful", "amazing") with factual descriptions
  2. Use precise technical language that respects reader intelligence
  3. Focus on concrete benefits and measurable outcomes, not vague claims
  
  ### Installation & Setup
  4. System requirements and installation:
     - Node.js version requirement: **>=20** (always specify this)
     - Show only essential commands in main flow (typically just `install`)
     - Move advanced options (beta channels, local dev) to separate sections
     - Provide clear prerequisites upfront
  
  ### Configuration File Documentation (CRITICAL)
  5. ALL config.yaml examples MUST include `sourcesPath` - never show incomplete configs
  6. Emphasize `sourcesPath` importance prominently:
     - It's the PRIMARY determinant of content quality, accuracy, and relevance
     - AI uses ONLY these sources as references
     - Missing or sparse sources result in generic, low-quality content
  7. Configuration examples must be production-ready with realistic values
  8. Show complete field sets - don't omit required fields for brevity
  
  ### CLI Documentation Standards
  9. Always show CLI commands in original English - do not translate:
     - Command names, flags, and options stay in English
     - Interactive prompts should match exact CLI text
     - Menu selections should use exact English text from the tool
  10. When describing CLI interactions, quote exact menu text, don't paraphrase
