# Managing Components

Websites generated by AIGNE WebSmith are constructed from a library of pre-designed visual elements called components. These components are the building blocks of your pages, such as hero sections, feature lists, pricing tables, and FAQ accordions. The `component` command allows you to manage and update this library to ensure your website has access to the latest designs and functionalities.

This section explains how to use the `component pull` command to synchronize your local component library with the one defined in your Pages Kit project.

## Overview of the Component Library

The component library is a collection of standardized, reusable page elements. When you generate a website, WebSmith selects and configures the most appropriate components from this library to build your pages.

Keeping this library updated is important for two main reasons:
1.  **Access to New Designs**: As new visual components are designed and added to your Pages Kit project, pulling them into your local library makes them available for the AI to use.
2.  **Bug Fixes and Improvements**: Updates may contain improvements or fixes to existing components, enhancing the quality and appearance of your website.

## Pulling and Updating Components

The `aigne web component pull` command fetches the latest version of the component library from a specific URL provided by your Pages Kit project.

### Command Syntax

To pull the latest components, use the following command structure:

```bash
aigne web component pull --url <your_component_pull_url>
```

You can also use the alias `comp`:

```bash
aigne web comp pull --url <your_component_pull_url>
```

### Parameters

<x-field-group>
  <x-field data-name="--url" data-type="string" data-required="true">
    <x-field-desc markdown>The unique URL for pulling components from your Pages Kit project. This URL contains the necessary project ID and security credentials. You can typically find this URL within your project's settings page in Pages Kit.</x-field-desc>
  </x-field>
</x-field-group>

### The Update Process

Updating your component library is a straightforward but important process. Follow these steps carefully.

#### Step 1: Run the Pull Command

Execute the command with the specific URL provided by your Pages Kit project.

```bash
aigne web component pull --url "https://your-pages-kit/api/projects/your-project-id/components/pull?secret=your-secret&hash=your-hash"
```

The tool will connect to the URL and download the latest component library definition.

#### Step 2: Review the Changes

After a successful download, WebSmith will display a summary of the changes. It will show a comparison between your existing library and the new one, detailing the number of "atomic" (basic) and "composite" (complex) components.

An example of the output might look like this:

```
âœ… Pull Components successfully (not saved yet)!
ðŸ“Š New Components Statistics:
  ðŸ”¹ Atomic components: 10 (9 â†’ 10)
    â€¢ LogoV1 - A component to display a heading and a list of logos...
    â€¢ RichText - A RichText component primarily displays the title...
    â€¢ NewFeatureCard - A brand new card for features...
  ðŸ§© Composite components: 22 (22 â†’ 22)
    â€¢ Logo Wall - Structure - Optional section title...
    â€¢ User Review - Structure (top â†’ bottom) - Review Content/Quote...
```

This summary allows you to verify the incoming changes before they are applied.

#### Step 3: Confirm the Update

WebSmith will then prompt you for confirmation before making any permanent changes to your local files.

```
Do you want to update (save) the built-in components file? (y/N)
```

-   Press `y` and `Enter` to proceed with the update.
-   Press `n` or `Enter` to cancel the operation. No changes will be made.

#### Step 4: Re-generate Your Website

If you confirm the update, WebSmith will perform two critical actions:

1.  **Save the New Library**: It overwrites your local `builtin-component-library.yaml` file with the new version.
2.  **Clear Generated Content**: To ensure your website is rebuilt correctly with the new components, it will **delete all previously generated page files** from your workspace and output directories.

Once the process is complete, you will see a confirmation message and a reminder for the next step.

```
ðŸ’¾ New components saved.
ðŸ§¹ Cleaned previous generated content.
ðŸš€ Next: please run below command to re-generate pages:

  `aigne web generate`
```

You must now run the `generate` command to create your website pages using the updated component library.

## Summary

The `component pull` command is the standard procedure for keeping your website's visual building blocks in sync with your central Pages Kit repository. The process involves pulling the latest library, reviewing the changes, confirming the update, and finally, re-generating your website to apply the new components.
