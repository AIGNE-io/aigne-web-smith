# Generating a Website

The core function of AIGNE WebSmith is to generate a complete, professional website from your source content and a set of defined requirements. This process is handled by the `generate` command, which orchestrates a series of AI agents to plan, write, and structure your site.

This guide details the `generate` command and explains how to define your website's requirements in the `config.yaml` file, which acts as the primary blueprint for the AI.

## The `generate` Command

The `aigne web generate` command initiates the entire website creation process. It reads your configuration, analyzes your source materials, plans the website's structure, generates content for each page, and assembles the final files.

### Usage

To run the generation process, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
aigne web generate
```

You can also use the aliases `gen` or `g`:

```bash
aigne web gen
```

### The Generation Process

When you run the `generate` command, WebSmith performs the following sequence of operations:

1.  **Load Configuration**: It first looks for and loads the `config.yaml` file to understand your high-level requirements. If this file doesn't exist, it will automatically initiate a guided setup to create one.
2.  **Analyze Sources**: The AI scans the documents, markdown files, and other materials specified in the `sourcesPath` of your configuration to understand the subject matter.
3.  **Plan Website Structure**: Based on the purpose, audience, and source content, the AI proposes a logical sitemap for your website, outlining all the pages and their hierarchy. You will be prompted to review and approve this structure before content generation begins.
4.  **Generate Page Content**: For each page in the approved structure, the AI generates detailed content, including titles, descriptions, and sections composed of professional components like hero banners, feature lists, and FAQs.
5.  **Save Website Files**: The final, structured content for each page is saved as YAML files in the directory specified by `pagesDir` in your configuration. These files are now ready for publishing.

### Parameters

The `generate` command accepts several optional parameters to customize its behavior.

<x-field-group>
  <x-field data-name="glossary" data-type="string" data-required="false">
    <x-field-desc markdown>Specifies the path to a glossary file (e.g., `@glossary.md`). This ensures that project-specific terms are used consistently throughout the generated content.</x-field-desc>
  </x-field>
  <x-field data-name="forceRegenerate" data-type="boolean" data-required="false">
    <x-field-desc markdown>If set to `true`, the command will regenerate all pages from scratch, overwriting any previously generated files. This is useful after making significant changes to the `config.yaml` file or your source documents.</x-field-desc>
  </x-field>
</x-field-group>

**Example with parameters:**

```bash
# Regenerate the entire website using a glossary file
aigne web generate --forceRegenerate --glossary "@glossary.md"
```

## The Configuration File (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` file is the blueprint for your website. It provides the AI with the necessary context and constraints to build a site that meets your specific needs. This file defines the project, the site's purpose and audience, language settings, and file locations.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the key properties within the `config.yaml` file.

## Summary

By combining the `generate` command with a well-defined `config.yaml` file, you can efficiently produce a complete website tailored to your exact specifications. This process automates the heavy lifting of site structure and content creation, allowing you to focus on providing high-quality source material.

After generating your website, the next step is to make it available online.
