# Publish to your own website

This guide provides a systematic procedure for publishing your generated website content directly to your own existing website infrastructure. This method is intended for users who manage their own ArcBlock-powered website and wish to integrate content generated by AIGNE WebSmith.

Publishing to a custom website offers complete control over hosting and integration. Before proceeding, ensure your existing website is compatible and properly configured.

## Prerequisites

To successfully publish to your own website, the following conditions must be met:

1.  **A Generated Website:** You must have already generated your website pages using the `aigne web generate` command. The generated content should be present in your project's output directory.
2.  **A Blocklet Server-Powered Website:** Your target website must be a running Blocklet application. AIGNE WebSmith integrates directly with the Blocklet Server environment.
3.  **Required Component:** The **Pages Kit** component must be installed and running on your target website. This component provides the necessary APIs for AIGNE WebSmith to upload and manage your content.

If your website is not yet set up, you can acquire the necessary components from the Blocklet Store:

- [Install Pages Kit on your website](https://store.blocklet.dev/blocklets/z8ia29UsENBg6tLZUKi2HABj38Cw1LmHZocbQ)

## Publishing Process

The publishing process involves running a command, selecting the appropriate option, providing your website's URL, and authorizing the AIGNE WebSmith CLI to connect to your site.

### Step 1: Initiate the Publish Command

Begin the process by running the `publish` command in your terminal from your project directory.

```bash Command Line icon=lucide:terminal
aigne web publish
```

### Step 2: Select Publishing Option

You will be presented with several publishing options. Use the arrow keys to highlight and select **"Your existing website"**.

```text Publishing Options
? Select platform to publish your pages:
  WebSmith Cloud (https://websmith.aigne.io) ‚Äì Free hosting. Your pages will be public accessible. Best for open-source projects or community sharing.
‚ùØ Your existing website - Integrate and publish directly on your current site (setup required)
  New dedicated website - Paid service. Create a new website with custom domain and hosting for professional use.
```

### Step 3: Provide Your Website URL

After selecting the custom option, you will be prompted to enter the URL of your website.

```text Enter URL
? Please enter your website URL:
‚Ä∫ https://my-awesome-site.com
```

Enter the full URL of your website where the Pages Kit component is installed and press Enter.

### Step 4: Authorize the CLI

For the first connection to a new website, the CLI requires your authorization to publish content. This is a one-time setup process for each website.

1.  **Browser Authentication:** Your default web browser will automatically open a page for you to connect and authorize the CLI.
2.  **Log In:** You will be prompted to log in to your website using your DID Wallet.
3.  **Approve Connection:** After logging in, you must approve the request from "AIGNE WebSmith" to access your site. The request will ask for permissions to manage pages.

Once approved, a secure access token is generated and stored locally in your home directory (`~/.aigne/web-smith-connected.yaml`). This token will be used for all subsequent publish operations to this specific URL, so you will not need to repeat the authorization step.

### Step 5: Await Confirmation

After authorization, the CLI will proceed to:

1.  Bundle your generated page files and assets.
2.  Upload all referenced media files.
3.  Publish the page content to your website.

Upon successful completion, a confirmation message will be displayed in the terminal, including the live URLs for your newly published pages.

```text Success Message
‚úÖ Pages published successfully! (`5/5` pages, `12` media assets)

üîó Live URLs:
   https://my-awesome-site.com/docs/
   https://my-awesome-site.com/docs/introduction
   https://my-awesome-site.com/docs/getting-started
   https://my-awesome-site.com/docs/api-reference
   https://my-awesome-site.com/docs/contact

üí° Optional: Update specific pages (`aigne web update`) or refine website structure (`aigne web generate`)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error during the publishing process, refer to the common issues below.

- **Error: "The provided URL is not a valid website on ArcBlock platform"**
  - **Cause:** The URL you entered does not point to a valid Blocklet application.
  - **Solution:** Verify that the URL is correct and that the website is running. Ensure you have included the correct protocol (e.g., `https://`).

- **Error: "This website does not have required components for publishing"**
  - **Cause:** The target website is a valid Blocklet but is missing the required "Pages Kit" component.
  - **Solution:** Install the Pages Kit component on your website. You can find instructions [here](https://www.arcblock.io/docs/blocklet-development/en/add-components).

- **Error: "Unable to connect" or "Failed to obtain access token"**
  - **Cause:** This typically indicates a network issue, or the target server is unavailable. It can also occur if you reject the authorization request in your browser.
  - **Solution:** Check your internet connection, ensure the website URL is correct and accessible, and re-run the `aigne web publish` command, making sure to approve the authorization request.
