# Using the Interactive Chat

The `chat` command provides an interactive, conversational interface for building and managing your website. Instead of running individual commands like `generate` or `update`, you can describe your needs in plain language, and the AI assistant will guide you through the process. This is an ideal starting point for users who prefer a more guided experience.

## How It Works

The interactive chat session is powered by a dedicated AI agent that understands your requests and can use other WebSmith tools to perform tasks. It maintains a memory of your conversation, allowing you to make sequential changes and build on previous actions.

The general workflow follows a simple, conversational loop:

```d2
direction: down

start: {
  label: "Start Chat Session"
  shape: oval
}

user_input: {
  label: "User provides a request\n(e.g., 'Create a website')"
}

ai_process: {
  label: "AI Assistant analyzes the request"
}

execute_task: {
  label: "AI executes the appropriate command\n(generate, update, publish, etc.)"
  shape: diamond
}

show_result: {
  label: "Assistant shows the result\nand awaits the next instruction"
}

end: {
  label: "End Chat Session"
  shape: oval
}

start -> user_input
user_input -> ai_process
ai_process -> execute_task
execute_task -> show_result: "Success"
show_result -> user_input
execute_task -> user_input: "Needs more info"
user_input -> end: "User types 'exit'"
```

## Starting an Interactive Session

To begin, run the `chat` command from your terminal:

```bash
aigne web chat
```

This will launch the assistant, which will greet you and wait for your instructions.

## What You Can Do

The chat assistant can perform most of the core tasks available in the AIGNE WebSmith CLI. You can simply ask it to:

*   **Generate a new website**: Describe your website requirements, target audience, and desired style.
*   **Update existing content**: Specify which page or section you want to change and provide the new details.
*   **Translate pages**: Request translation of specific pages into another language.
*   **Publish your site**: Tell the assistant you're ready to publish your website to Pages Kit.
*   **Manage files**: Ask to see the current file structure or content of a specific page.

## Example Conversation

Here is an example of how you might use the interactive chat to create, modify, and publish a simple website.

```bash Command Line icon=lucide:terminal
aigne web chat

> Welcome to the AIGNE WebSmith interactive assistant!
> How can I help you build your website today?

You:
I need to create a website for a new SaaS product that helps teams manage their projects.

> Of course. Could you please provide a few more details?
> - What are the core features of the product?
> - Who is the target audience?
> - What style should the website have (e.g., business, modern, playful)?

You:
The main features are task tracking, team collaboration, and reporting. The target audience is small to medium-sized business owners. Let's go with a modern business style.

> Thank you. I have enough information to plan the website structure.
> I will now generate the following pages:
> - Home
> - Features
> - Pricing
> - About Us
> - Contact
> ...
> [Generation process starts]
> ...
> Website generation is complete. The files have been saved to the 'output' directory.
> What would you like to do next?

You:
On the homepage, add a section for customer testimonials.

> Understood. I will add a customer testimonials section to the homepage.
> [Update process starts]
> ...
> The homepage has been updated. Is there anything else?

You:
No, that's all for now. Please publish the website.

> I will now publish the website to your configured Pages Kit project.
> [Publishing process starts]
> ...
> Your website has been successfully published.
> You can now exit the chat by typing 'exit'.

You:
exit

> Goodbye!
```

## Exiting the Chat

To end your interactive session at any time, simply type `exit` or `quit` and press Enter.
