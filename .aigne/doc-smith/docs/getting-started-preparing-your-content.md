# Preparing Your Content

The quality of the website generated by AIGNE WebSmith is directly proportional to the quality of the information you provide. A clear and detailed set of inputs allows the AI to create a website that accurately reflects your goals and requires minimal revision.

This guide outlines the essential content and information you should prepare before generating your site. Taking the time to gather these materials will streamline the process and lead to a superior final product. Once your content is ready, you can proceed to the [Your First Website](./getting-started-your-first-website.md) tutorial to generate your site.

## 1. Define Your Website's Blueprint

The most critical input for the AI is a clear description of your website's purpose, structure, and style. This is typically provided in a YAML configuration file. The AI uses these instructions to plan the site architecture and generate content.

Your blueprint should clearly define the following aspects:

### Website Requirements (`rules`)

This is a detailed set of instructions for the AI. Be as specific as possible. A well-defined set of rules should include:

*   **Page Structure**: List all the pages you want on your website. For example: Home, About Us, Features, Pricing, Blog, and Contact.
*   **Page Content**: For each page, briefly describe its purpose and the key information it should contain. For instance, "The Features page should detail the three core functionalities of our product with a brief description for each."
*   **Primary Goals**: State the main objective of the website. This helps the AI prioritize content and include effective calls-to-action (CTAs). Examples include: "Encourage visitors to sign up for a free trial," or "Generate leads through the contact form."
*   **Tone and Style**: Describe the desired personality of your website. Is it professional and corporate, or casual and friendly? Should the language be technical or simple?

Here is a practical example of a `rules` section in a YAML file:

```yaml my-website.yaml
rules: |
  Create a modern SaaS product website that includes:
  1. A homepage introducing the product and its core features.
  2. A pricing page with a comparison table for three distinct plans.
  3. A page showcasing customer success stories or testimonials.
  4. A contact page with a form and support information.

  Requirements:
  - The style should be professional and business-oriented.
  - The content must highlight the product's key advantages.
  - Include clear calls-to-action (CTAs) to guide users to sign up for a trial.
```

### Target Audience (`targetAudience`)

Defining your target audience is crucial. The AI uses this information to tailor the vocabulary, tone, and complexity of the content to resonate with your intended visitors.

*   **Good Example:** `targetAudience: "Technical decision-makers and CTOs at mid-sized tech companies."`
*   **Less Effective Example:** `targetAudience: "Everyone."`

### Language and Style

You can also specify the primary language and a general style theme for your website.

*   **`locale`**: The language for the website content (e.g., `en` for English, `zh` for Chinese).
*   **`websiteStyle`**: A high-level style descriptor (e.g., `business`, `modern`, `minimalist`).

## 2. Gather Existing Source Materials

AIGNE WebSmith can analyze existing documents and files to gain a deeper understanding of your project, brand, and offerings. Providing these materials gives the AI valuable context, resulting in more relevant and accurate content.

Consider gathering the following types of files:

*   **Text Documents**: README files, project documentation, marketing copy, white papers, or any text that describes your product or business.
*   **Media Assets**: High-quality images and videos are essential for a professional website. This includes logos, product screenshots, team photos, and promotional videos.

Organize these files into a dedicated project folder. You can then instruct WebSmith to use this folder as a source of information during the generation process.

### Preparing Media Assets

For the best visual results, it is important to prepare your media files correctly.

*   **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images. To ensure your images display correctly and are not filtered out, they should have a **minimum width of 800 pixels**.
*   **Organization**: Keep all your media files in a designated subfolder (e.g., `/assets` or `/images`) within your project directory for easy management.
