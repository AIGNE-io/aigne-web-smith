# Preparing Your Content

AIGNE WebSmith uses Artificial Intelligence to build your website, but the quality of its output is directly dependent on the quality of the information you provide. Preparing your content and clarifying your goals beforehand is the most critical step to ensure the AI generates a professional, accurate, and effective website that meets your needs.

This guide outlines the essential information and assets you should have ready before you begin. A systematic approach to content preparation will streamline the generation process and yield superior results.

## 1. Gather Your Source Documents

The AI will build your website's pages based on the text and information you provide in source documents. These are the raw materials for your website's content.

### What to Include

Collect any existing documents that describe your business, product, or service. The more detailed and well-organized your source files are, the better. Good source files include:
*   Business plans or executive summaries
*   Product descriptions and specification sheets
*   Marketing brochures or flyers
*   Company "About Us" pages or mission statements
*   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their answers
*   Articles or blog posts you have written

### File Formatting

*   **Use simple formats:** Plain text (`.txt`) or Markdown (`.md`) files are ideal. The system can also process other common document types.
*   **Organize your content:** Create a single, dedicated folder on your computer to hold all your source files. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to point the AIGNE CLI to the correct location.
*   **Use clear file names:** Name your files descriptively (e.g., `product-features.txt`, `company-history.md`). This helps both you and the AI understand the purpose of each file.

## 2. Collect Media Assets (Images and Videos)

Visuals are essential for a professional website. AIGNE WebSmith can incorporate your images and videos into the generated design.

### Image Quality

High-quality images are crucial for a modern website. Low-resolution photos will appear pixelated and unprofessional, especially on large screens.
*   **Minimum Width:** Ensure your images have a minimum width of **800 pixels**. The system will automatically filter out smaller images to maintain quality.
*   **Relevance:** Choose images that are directly relevant to your content.
*   **File Naming:** Just like with documents, use descriptive file names (e.g., `team-photo-2023.jpg` instead of `IMG_4812.JPG`).

### Media Organization

Place all your final, high-quality images and videos into a subfolder within your main source content folder. A common name for this is `assets` or `media`.

## 3. (Optional) Create a Glossary for Consistency

To ensure the AI uses specific terms, brand names, and acronyms correctly and consistently across the entire website, you can provide a glossary file. This is particularly useful if your industry has specialized terminology.

A glossary is a simple text file where each line defines a term.

**Example Glossary File (`glossary.txt`)**

```
AIGNE: Stands for Artificial Intelligence General-purpose Networked Entity.
WebSmith: The official name of the AI website generation tool.
Pages Kit: The platform where websites are published.
```

This step ensures brand consistency and reduces the need for manual corrections later.
