# Your First Website

This tutorial provides a direct, hands-on guide to generating a complete, multi-page website. The process involves creating a simple configuration file by answering a few questions and then running a single command. No prior technical experience is required.

By the end of this guide, you will have a set of locally saved web pages, generated by AI based on your specific requirements, ready for review and publishing.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have successfully installed the AIGNE CLI. If you have not yet installed the CLI, please follow the instructions in the [Installation](./getting-started-installation.md) guide.

## Step 1: Create a Project Directory

First, create a new folder on your computer where your website's configuration and generated files will be stored. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my-first-website

# Navigate into the new directory
cd my-first-website
```

All subsequent commands should be run from within this `my-first-website` directory.

## Step 2: Run the Generate Command

The entire website generation process is initiated with a single command. In your terminal, run the following:

```bash aigne web generate icon=material-symbols:rocket-launch-outline
aigne web generate
```

Because this is a new project, WebSmith will detect that no configuration file exists and will automatically launch an interactive setup wizard to help you create one.

## Step 3: Complete the Configuration Wizard

The setup wizard will guide you through a series of questions to understand the kind of website you want to build. Below is a breakdown of the information you will be asked to provide.

1.  **Website Purpose**: Select the primary goal of your website (e.g., Product Showcase, Documentation Hub, Marketing Site). This helps the AI tailor the structure and content appropriately.
2.  **Target Audience**: Specify who will be visiting your site (e.g., Customers, Developers, Business Owners). This influences the tone and complexity of the generated text.
3.  **Website Scale**: Choose the approximate number of pages you need (e.g., Minimal, Standard, Comprehensive). This determines the depth of the site structure the AI will create.
4.  **Primary Language**: Select the main language for your website's content.
5.  **Translation Languages**: Optionally, select other languages you want your website to be translated into.
6.  **Pages Directory**: Specify the folder where the final website files will be saved. The default `aigne/web-smith/pages` is suitable for most projects.
7.  **Data Source Paths**: Provide paths to local files or directories (e.g., `./docs`, `../project-brief.md`) that the AI should use as source material. If you don't provide any, WebSmith will analyze your current directory and suggest relevant files.
8.  **Custom Rules**: Add any specific instructions or requirements you have for the website, such as brand guidelines or content constraints.

Once you have answered all the questions, WebSmith will save your choices into a file named `config.yaml` in your project directory.

### Example Configuration File

Your generated `config.yaml` file will look similar to this. You can edit this file directly at any time to adjust your website's settings.

```yaml config.yaml icon=mdi:file-document-outline

projectLogo: ""
projectId: d2a8b9e7-f6c5-4d32-9a1b-0e8c7d6f5a4b

## Step 4: Review and Approve the Website Plan

After the configuration is saved, the AI will analyze your requirements and data sources to create a proposed structure for your website. This plan will be displayed in your terminal for review.

You will be prompted to approve the plan or request changes. For this first website, you can simply approve the proposed structure to continue.

## Step 5: View Your Generated Website

Once you approve the plan, the AI will write the content and generate the necessary template files for each page. The process may take a few minutes, depending on the number of pages.

The generated files, which are saved in the directory you specified (e.g., `aigne/web-smith/pages`), are templates used for publishing. To view the final, rendered website as it will appear online, you must first publish it. This step converts the templates into a live website.

## Summary

Congratulations, you have successfully generated your first website using AIGNE WebSmith. The core process involved running a single command, answering a series of questions to create a configuration file, and letting the AI build the site based on your input.
