# Update Website

Use this guide to select the right update workflow and then dive into the detailed sub-guides for structure or page-level changes.

Once your website is generated, you will inevitably need to make changes. AIGNE WebSmith provides a clear and structured approach to keeping your site current. Updates typically fall into two categories: modifying the overall structure of your site or refining the content within individual pages.

This section provides a high-level overview of both processes. For detailed, step-by-step instructions, please refer to the specific sub-documents linked below.
