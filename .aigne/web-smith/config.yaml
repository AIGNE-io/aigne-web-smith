# Custom Rules: Define specific page generation rules and requirements
rules: |
  ### I. Core Messaging & Strategy: Foundational elements that define *what* you communicate to the user.
  1. Answer Critical Questions "Above the Fold": The very first screen a user sees must clearly and immediately answer:
    * What it is: A concise description of the product.
    * Who it's for: The specific target audience (e.g., solo founders, small teams).
    * Why it's different: Your unique value proposition (e.g., "open, composable, exportable code, agent workflow").
    * Primary Action: A single, clear Call to Action (CTA) that aligns with the user's main goal.
  2. Establish Credibility with Proof: Don't expect users to trust your claims. Show them proof early in the narrative.
    * Show, Don't Just Tell: The most powerful proof is a demo. Include a short (30-45s) silent video loop or a link to a real site built with the tool.
    * Use Social Proof: Before explaining "How it Works," insert tangible evidence like a customer logo, a compelling data point (e.g., "Used by 50+ teams"), or a strong user quote.
  3. Define a Clear Call to Action (CTA):
    * Align CTA with the Audience: The primary CTA should be the main action you want your target user to take (e.g., "Generate My Site").
    * Prioritize CTAs: Relegate secondary actions (like "See it on GitHub") to less prominent positions (tertiary buttons or footer links), especially for non-developer audiences.
    * Maintain a Persistent Mobile CTA: On mobile, a single primary CTA should always be visible.
  ### II. Structure & Narrative Flow: Present information to build interest and trust.
  1. Adopt a Persuasive Narrative Arc: Structure the page to guide the user through a logical journey. A proven flow is:
    * Problem: State the pain point you solve.
    * Outcome: Show the successful result or benefit.
    * Proof: Provide evidence (testimonials, demos, data).
    * How It Works: Explain the process in simple steps.
    * Quick Start / Get Started: Give clear, actionable instructions.
    * Pricing / FAQ: Address practical questions and signal cost.
    * Final CTA: The closing call to action.
  2. Ensure Completeness: Never show incomplete processes. A "Quick Start" with only Step 1 of 3 erodes user confidence. Either show the full process or remove the section.
  3. Anchor Features to Concrete Benefits: When listing features, don't just name them. Connect each feature to a specific, tangible output (e.g., instead of "Powerful Generator," use "Generates sitemaps, routes, and components").
  4. Anticipate User Questions: End the page with an FAQ section that addresses common concerns like data ownership, code exporting, SEO capabilities, hosting, and usage limits.
  ### III. Language & Copywriting: Focus on the tone, clarity, and impact of your words.
  1. Be Specific and Factual:
    * Avoid Hyperbole and Clichés: Eliminate marketing fluff like “magic,” “rock-solid,” “masterpiece,” or “speed of thought.” These phrases reduce credibility.
    * Make Testable Claims: Instead of vague adjectives like “SEO-optimized,” state exactly what you do ("Generates titles, meta descriptions, OG tags, and sitemaps").
  2. Write with Clarity and Confidence:
    * Use Active Voice: Employ strong, direct verbs (e.g., "Plan, generate, publish"). Avoid passive phrases like "Let our AI be your strategist."
    * Remove Filler Words: Cut words that weaken statements (e.g., change “*Even* supports multiple languages” to “Supports multiple languages”).
    * Use Positive Framing: Focus on the benefit, not the problem. Instead of “Forget the tedious process…”, start with “Build your website in minutes…”
  3. Maintain Consistency:
    * Product Naming: Use exact product names consistently (e.g., always "Pages Kit," not "PagesKit"; ensure "AIGNE" is always used correctly).
    * Terminology: Hyphenate terms uniformly ("AI-powered," "no-code").
    * Structure: Use parallel structure in lists and headings for scannability (e.g., "Plan & Evaluate," "Generate Content," "Publish & Export").
