        "answer": "The output is clean, component-based YAML designed for Pages Kit.
          This approach separates your content from the design, making it
          incredibly easy to manage, version, and integrate with other systems."

          about 2-3 minutes, and even a larger 15-page site typically takes only
          5-8 minutes. It's a total game-changer!"
