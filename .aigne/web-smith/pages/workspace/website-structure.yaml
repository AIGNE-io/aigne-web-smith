- title: "WebSmith: AI-Powered Website Generation"
  description: A single-page landing site introducing AIGNE WebSmith to potential
    customers. The page flows from a compelling Hero section that states the
    core value proposition, into a detailed Features section covering AI-powered
    generation, professional templates, quality assurance, and one-click
    publishing. It then presents a simple 'How It Works' guide to demonstrate
    ease of use, and concludes with a strong Call to Action to encourage user
    conversion.
