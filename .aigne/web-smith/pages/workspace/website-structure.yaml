- title: "AIGNE WebSmith: AI-Powered Website Generation"
  description: A comprehensive single-page overview of AIGNE WebSmith. The page
    guides visitors through the tool's value proposition, starting with a hero
    section that defines the product and its audience. It then builds trust with
    feature-benefit sections (AI Generation, Professional Templates, Quality
    Assurance, One-Click Publishing) and a visual 'How It Works' guide. A 'Quick
    Start' section provides actionable steps for users, followed by an essential
    FAQ to address common questions. The page is anchored by clear
    calls-to-action to encourage user engagement.
