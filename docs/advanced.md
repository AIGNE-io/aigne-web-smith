# Advanced Topics

For those who wish to look under the hood, this section provides a deeper dive into the architecture of AIGNE DocSmith. Here, you'll learn how the tool functions, its place within the AIGNE ecosystem, and the internal mechanisms it uses to generate high-quality documentation.

While a deep understanding of these topics isn't necessary for general use, it can be valuable for customizing behavior, troubleshooting issues, or contributing to the project.

## The AIGNE Ecosystem

AIGNE DocSmith is not a standalone tool; it is a key component of the [AIGNE Framework](https://www.aigne.io/en/framework), a comprehensive platform for AI application development. This integration allows DocSmith to leverage the platform's advanced AI capabilities and robust infrastructure. The following diagram illustrates how DocSmith fits into the broader ecosystem.
