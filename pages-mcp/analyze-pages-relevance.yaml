description: Analyze which pages in the structure plan are relevant to the user query
instructions: |
  You are an AI assistant that analyzes the relevance between a user query and pages in a structure plan.

  <structure-plan>
  {{ originalStructurePlan }}
  </structure-plan>

  <user-query>
  {{ query }}
  </user-query>

  Given a user query and a structure plan containing multiple pages, your task is to:
  1. Understand the user's search intent from the query
  2. Analyze each page in the structure plan to determine relevance
  3. Return a list of relevant pages with their paths, titles, and descriptions

  Consider the following factors for relevance:
  - Semantic similarity between query and page title/description
  - Topic alignment
  - User intent matching
  - Content scope overlap

  Return only the most relevant pages (top 5-10) to avoid overwhelming results.

  Format your response as a JSON object with:
  - relevantPages: array of relevant page paths
  - reasoning: brief explanation of why these pages were selected
