Content and Organization:

- Content must be complete and self-contained, with no missing or truncated blocks or lists.
- Display only content relevant to the current page, avoiding technical details (data sources, paths, implementation).
- Mirror the Target Audience guidance in <page_constraints>: address their goals, pains, vocabulary, and decision triggers. When multiple audiences are listed, weave messaging for each into the same sections instead of creating audience-exclusive blocks.
- Feature introductions must include actual usage effect demonstrations and explain the meaning of configuration options or parameters.
- Whenever possible, vary adjacent sections instead of repeating the same section type to keep the page visually engaging and reduce monotony (list exception: all sections within the same `list` must reuse the identical component combination to maintain visual consistency).
- Hero sections must lead with a benefit-driven headline, follow with a one-sentence explaining how the AI delivers that benefit, stay scannable (headline + clear CTA), speak directly to the core pain being solved, and surface available trust signals (logos, testimonials, proof points) within the immediate viewport.
- Sections titled "Get Started", "What's Next", or similar progression prompts must include at least one CTA button that links to the relevant next step (docs, signup, demo, etc.) so users know exactly where to go next.
