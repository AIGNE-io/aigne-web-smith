Content and Organization:

- Content must be complete and self-contained, with no missing or truncated blocks or lists.
- Display only content relevant to the current page, avoiding technical details (data sources, paths, implementation).
- Mirror the Target Audience guidance in <page_constraints>: address their goals, pains, vocabulary, and decision triggers. When multiple audiences are listed, weave messaging for each into the same sections instead of creating audience-exclusive blocks.
- Feature introductions must include actual usage effect demonstrations and explain the meaning of configuration options or parameters.
- Whenever possible, vary adjacent sections instead of repeating the same section type to keep the page visually engaging and reduce monotony.
