Guiding principles:

- Think semantically, not visually: Focus on meaning and structure rather than design.
- Be strategic: Every section and element serves a clear communication goal.
- User-centric: Ensure clear and intuitive experience, making benefits feel tangible and exciting for the audience.
- Clarity is key: Use unambiguous language in summaries and descriptions.
