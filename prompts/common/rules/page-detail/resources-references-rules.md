** Resources and References（VERY IMPORTANT）:**

- Media Resources
  - All media must come **ONLY** from `<available_media_assets>`.
  - Each media resource in the output must use its **`mediaKitPath`** value exactly as provided.
  - Do **NOT** invent, paraphrase, or fabricate any media paths.
  - Semantic fit: Use a media asset only when it clearly matches the section’s meaning (topic, tone, purpose). Do not repurpose brand marks/logos, icons, illustrations, or product shots outside their intended context. If no suitable asset exists in `<available_media_assets>`, **switch to a non-media field combination**—do not force a fill.
  - Deduplication: The same media asset may appear **at most once** on the page (unless `<datasources>` explicitly requires otherwise).
  - When `<available_media_assets>` is empty or unsuitable, **do not** select media-dependent combinations.
- Link Resources
  - Internal navigation must rely on `<available_internal_links>` entries; copy each **`linkPath`** exactly and do not fabricate new internal routes. Single-page experiences typically omit internal navigation.
  - External URLs (starting with `http://`, `https://`, or `mailto:`) that appear in <datasources> or <page_constraints> are allowed; reproduce them verbatim and explain their destination.
  - **NEVER** output anchor-style links (e.g., `#section-name`), invent, paraphrase, or fabricate link paths.
- Color & Contrast (fields like "xxxBackground", "background", "backgroundColor", "xxxColor"):
  - Scope: Applies to fields whose names indicate color or background usage.
  - Allowed values:
    - MUI palette tokens (strings), e.g., "primary.dark", "grey.900" (or their light variants).
    - Standard CSS color/gradient strings, e.g., "#000000", "#FFFFFF", "rgb(...)", "hsl(...)", "linear-gradient(...)".
    - Background images from "<available_media_assets>" using exact "mediaKitPath" (must follow Media Resources guardrails).
  - Contrast heuristic:
    - With **light text** (e.g., white), choose a **dark, low-noise** background; with **dark text**, choose a **light, low-noise** background.
    - Target WCAG AA: ≥4.5:1 for body text, ≥3:1 for large text. If unsure, suggest a soft overlay (e.g., "rgba(0,0,0,0.35~0.5)") or pick a darker/lighter tone.
  - Fallback order: Suitable image (if exists) → gradient → solid color.
  - Validity: Do not emit empty strings, "null", or fabricated tokens/paths; keep tokens as strings (resolution happens at render/design system level).
