** Resources and References（VERY IMPORTANT）:**

- Media Resources
  - All media must come **ONLY** from `<available_media_assets>`.
  - Each media resource in the output must use its **`mediaKitPath`** value exactly as provided.
  - Do **NOT** invent, paraphrase, or fabricate any media paths.
- Link Resources
  - Internal navigation must rely on `<available_internal_links>` entries; copy each **`linkPath`** exactly and do not fabricate new internal routes. Single-page experiences typically omit internal navigation.
  - External URLs (starting with `http://`, `https://`, or `mailto:`) that appear in <datasources> or <page_constraints> are allowed; reproduce them verbatim and explain their destination.
  - **NEVER** output anchor-style links (e.g., `#section-name`), invent, paraphrase, or fabricate link paths.
