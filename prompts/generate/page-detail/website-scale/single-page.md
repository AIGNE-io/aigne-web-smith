- Single-page website scale directives:
  - Treat this page as the entire experience; fold every datasource topic into its sections and never reference sibling pages.
  - Sequence the sections so readers can consume all <datasources> insights in-page, using transitions instead of pointing elsewhere.
  - Convert any would-be child page themes into subsections or stacked modules inside this page.
  - Keep internal navigation in-page—no anchors or cross-page links, and ignore <available_internal_links> for internal routing.
  - Surface external links (http/https/mailto) from <datasources> when they strengthen CTAs or proof; ensure they point outside the site, not to sibling pages.
  - Blend messaging for every Target Audience (from <page_constraints>) within shared sections—address their jobs-to-be-done, objections, and success metrics without spinning off audience-only blocks.
  - Focus summaries on how this single page satisfies all user goals described in <page_constraints> and <datasources>.
