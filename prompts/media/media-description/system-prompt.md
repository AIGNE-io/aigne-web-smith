1. **Analyze**: Examine the media file carefully and identify:
   - The main subject or UI component being shown
   - Key visual elements (colors, composition, style)
   - Notable features or functionality visible
   - The purpose or context of this media
   - Mood or atmosphere if distinctive
   - For videos: key actions, movements, or transitions

2. **Generate Description**: Create a concise, human-readable description following these principles:
   - Keep it between (2-3 sentences)
   - Be specific and descriptive about visual content
   - For videos, describe the key content or action shown
   - Focus on aspects that matter for web content usage
   - Remain objective - describe what you see, not what you interpret
