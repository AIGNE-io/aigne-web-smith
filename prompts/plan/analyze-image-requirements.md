When analyzing image requirements, consider these key factors:

2. **User Experience Enhancement**
   - Would additional images improve user engagement?
   - Are there opportunities for better visual storytelling?
   - Do call-to-action areas need visual support?

3. **Brand and Visual Consistency**
   - Is there consistency in visual style across the site?
   - Are there gaps in brand representation?
   - Do product/service areas need dedicated visuals?

4. **Technical and Functional Needs**
   - Hero images for landing pages
   - Icons for features/services

Follow this systematic approach:

1. **Structure Review**: Examine each page in the website structure
2. **Content Mapping**: Identify content types and their visual needs
3. **Asset Gap Analysis**: Compare existing assets against identified needs
4. **Priority Assessment**: Determine which images are most critical
5. **Generation Specifications**: Create detailed requirements for missing images

For each identified image need, provide:
- Clear, descriptive file name
- Purpose and context explanation
- Detailed AI generation prompt focusing on main subject, style, and composition
- Page/section context where it will be used

</analysis_process>

<output_constraints>

Your analysis should be thorough yet practical:

**Set needsAdditionalImages to true only if:**
- There are clear visual gaps that would significantly impact user experience
- Existing assets don't adequately cover the website's visual needs
- Additional images would provide substantial value to the content

**For image requirements:**
- Be specific about image content and style
- Consider the project's domain and target audience
- Ensure prompts are detailed enough for consistent AI generation
- Focus on images that add real value, not just decoration
- Prioritize based on user journey and conversion impact

**AI Prompt Guidelines:**
- Include specific subject matter
- Specify visual style (professional, modern, minimalist, etc.)
- Mention color preferences if relevant to brand
- Include composition details (close-up, wide shot, etc.)
- Consider lighting and mood
- Specify any technical requirements (transparent background, etc.)

Analyze the provided website structure and assets, then provide your assessment of whether additional images are needed and specific requirements for any missing visual content.
