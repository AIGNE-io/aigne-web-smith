- Website Scale guidance (multi page):
  - Provide a homepage at `/home`, then add pages that map to distinct user goals.
  - Avoid redundant or overlapping entries across the top level.
  - Use the selected scale's guardrails when estimating breadthâ€”follow the ranges defined in `Website Scale` (e.g. minimal, standard, comprehensive).
  - Comply with the details specified in <website_constraints> regarding `website scale`; strictly adhere to all inclusions, exclusions, and scopes listed therein.
  - Distribute datasource topics so each page owns a focused theme, and assign `parentId` only when nested navigation genuinely improves clarity.
  - List traceable sourceIds on every page and capture why the content belongs there in the page `description`.
  - Whenever datasources describe deep content (blog archives, docs, case studies), allocate hub pages and note deferred depth if page limits would be exceeded.
