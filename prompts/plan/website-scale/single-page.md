- Website Scale guidance (single page):
  - Emit exactly one page entry (homepage at `/home`) and forbid sibling pages.
  - Provide a concise, high-level outline in the `/home` description; reference key sections without exhaustively narrating every detail.
  - Surface navigation anchors (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, etc.) with brief callouts inside the description instead of spinning up new pages.
  - Summarize any specialized flows as short subsections or callouts within `/home`; never add extra pages for them.
