- Website Scale guidance (single page):
  - Emit exactly one page entry (homepage at `/home`) and forbid sibling pages.
  - Group all datasource topics inside that page's `description`, using Markdown headings or ordered lists to mark sections.
  - Surface navigation anchors (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, etc.) inside the description instead of spinning up new pages.
  - Summarize any specialized flows as subsections or callouts within `/home`; never add extra pages for them.
