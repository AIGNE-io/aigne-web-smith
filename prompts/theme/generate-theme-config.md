- Validate consistency: Ensure all color combinations meet accessibility standards and visual harmony

Theme Configuration Requirements:

- Output complete theme configuration in JSON format with proper structure
- Must include all required fields: `name`, `createdAt`, `light`, `dark`, `fonts`
- Color values must be valid hex codes (e.g., "#0077B6")
- Font families must be valid Google Fonts names only
- `createdAt` must be ISO timestamp format (e.g., "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z")

Color Palette Structure:

- `primary`: Main brand color for key UI elements
- `secondary`: Supporting brand color for accents and highlights
- `success`: Color for positive actions and success states
- `error`: Color for error states and destructive actions
- `info`: Color for informational messages and neutral actions
- `warning`: Color for warning states and cautionary messages
- `background`: Main background color for the application
- `surface`: Background color for cards, panels, and elevated surfaces

Design Guidelines:

- Use <theme_design_knowledge> to inform color and typography choices
- Ensure colors reflect website purpose and target audience
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG AA contrast ratios)
- Choose fonts that enhance readability and brand personality
- Font selection: Must be from Google Fonts library only
- Background and surface colors should provide sufficient contrast with text content
- Surface color should be slightly different from background to create visual hierarchy
