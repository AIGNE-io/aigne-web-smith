- According to <page_constraints> and using <datasources> to generate page content
- Modify the output according to <feedback_and_history> (if provided)
- Apply <user_preferences> constraints and requirements (if provided)
- Ensure all outputs meet the <output_constraints> and <output_examples>

Current page information:

- title: {{title}}
- description: {{description}}
- path: {{path}}
- parentId: {{parentId}}

<structure_plan>

This is the website structure. You can refer to it to understand where the current page fits within the website structure.

Format and Structure:

- Output complete page semantic structure using YAML format, paying attention to indentation and hierarchy.
- Page must include essential fields such as `meta`, `sections`.
- Each section must have clear `name` (camelCase), `summary` (purpose description), and specific content description.

Content and Organization:

- Content must be complete and self-contained, with no missing or truncated blocks or lists.
- Display only content relevant to the current page, avoiding technical details (data sources, paths, implementation).
- If sub-pages exist, current page should only show overview and guide navigation, avoiding duplication with other page content.
- Feature introductions must include actual usage effect demonstrations and explain the meaning of configuration options or parameters.
- Do not include any internal page links or anchors within the content.

Style and Expression:

- Copy must be friendly, professional, clear, understandable, concise and engaging.
- Use natural transitions, clear organization, and well-structured information hierarchy.
- Avoid empty promotion, overly emotional or generic marketing language.

Resources and References:

- Media Resources
  - All media must come **only** from `<available_media_assets>`.
  - Each media resource in the output must use its **`mediaKitPath`** value exactly as provided.
  - Do **not** invent, paraphrase, or fabricate any media paths.
- Link Resources
  - All navigation links must come **only** from `<available_links>`.
  - Each link in the output must use its **`linkPath`** value exactly as provided.
  - Do **not** invent, paraphrase, or fabricate any link paths.

<output_examples>
Complete page semantic structure, output as YAML(this example is for reference only, please do not use it directly):

```yaml
meta: # Required - page metadata
  title: string # Page SEO title
  description: string # Page description for SEO and social sharing
  image: string # Social sharing image path (optional)

sections: # Required - page content blocks
  - name: string # Required - section functional identifier, use camelCase naming
    summary: string # Required - section purpose description, describing function and content intent
    # Following fields are all optional, use flexibly according to page design needs:
    title: string # Block title
    description: string # Block description/subtitle
    image: { src: string, caption: string } # Single image
    video: { src: string, caption: string } # Video content
    action: { text: string, link: string } # Primary action button
    code: { title: string, language: string, content: string } # Code example
    list: # List content
      - { ... } #  can contain any field combinations
    # Can add other fields as needed for page design
```
